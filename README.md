# Problem statement 
[] DataFrame Object 
[] Manipulation methods
  [] Method to concatenate DataFrames
  [] Method to obtain a subset of DataFrame with range of row or column
  [] Method to sort the rows by a column in the DataFrame
  [] Method to remove duplicate rows based on subset of columns
  [] Method to remove rows containing missing data in subset of columns
[] Statistics package and imputers
  a. Method compute variance, standard deviation, min, max,mean, median, mode and range of a column (Non numeric columns will only have mode)
  b. Method to fill in missing values of specified columns with a specified value.
  
[] Scalers 
  [] a. Method to perform Standard Scaling.
      Standard scaling is subtracting the mean from all values in the column and dividing by the standard deviation.
  [] b. Method to perform Min Max Scaling
      Min max scaling is subtracting the min from all values in the column and dividing by the range
